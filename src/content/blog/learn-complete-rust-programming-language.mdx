This is a complete Rust programming language course. The course covers the full spectrum of Rust, from basic syntax to advanced topics like generics and error handling.

The goal of the course is to teach you Rust. We assume you don’t know anything about Rust and hope to:

* Give you a comprehensive understanding of the Rust syntax and language.
* Enable you to modify existing programs and write new programs in Rust.
* Show you common Rust idioms.

## Assumptions

The course assumes that you already know how to program. Rust is a statically typed language and we will sometimes make comparisons with C and C++ to better explain or contrast the Rust approach.

If you know how to program in a dynamically typed language such as Python or JavaScript, then you will be able to follow along just fine too.

## Using Cargo

When you start reading about Rust, you will soon meet [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), the standard tool used in the Rust ecosystem to build and run Rust applications. Here we want to give a brief overview of what Cargo is and how it fits into the wider ecosystem and how it fits into this training.

### Installation Rustup

You can follow the instructions to install cargo and rust compiler, among other standard ecosystem tools with the [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) tool, which is maintained by the Rust Foundation.

Along with cargo and rustc, Rustup will install itself as a command line utility that you can use to install/switch toolchains, setup cross compilation, etc.

### Cargo run

If you want to experiment with the code on your own system, then you will need to first install Rust. Do this by following the [instructions in the Rust Book](#installation-rustup). This should give you a working `rustc` and `cargo`. At the time of writing, the latest stable Rust release has these version numbers:

```shell
% rustc --version
rustc 1.67.0 (fc594f156 2023-01-24)
% cargo --version
cargo 1.67.0 (8ecd4f20a 2023-01-10)
```

* Use `cargo new exercise` to create a new `exercise/` directory for your code:

  ```shell
  $ cargo new exercise
       Created binary (application) `exercise` package
  ```
* Navigate into `exercise/` and use `cargo run` to build and run your binary:

  ```shell
  $ cd exercise
  $ cargo run
     Compiling exercise v0.1.0 (/home/mgeisler/tmp/exercise)
      Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.75s
       Running `target/debug/exercise`
  Hello, world!
  ```

## What is Rust?



Rust is a new programming language which had its 1.0 release in 2015:

* Rust is a statically compiled language in a similar role as C++

  * `rustc` uses LLVM as its backend.
* Rust supports many [platforms and architectures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html):

  * x86, ARM, WebAssembly, …
  * Linux, Mac, Windows, …
* Rust is used for a wide range of devices:

  * firmware and boot loaders,
  * smart displays,
  * mobile phones,
  * desktops,
  * servers.
