Imitation game is a game to figure out is this is a machine's brain or any human's brain that actually replaying to you.

Today i watched the intimation game. the story of Alan turing. I learned so much from his life and most importantly the way he love his work.

one more think that came in my mind is why maths is so important for us to understand the machine. Alan turing was a mathematician i invented first computer or i can say a machine that can be reprogrammed. today i’m learning computer programming which means i’m learning how to program a computer and Alan builds that computer.



after Alan’s death new generation starts working on turing machines which is today we calls computers.

If i have to contribute to the society then no doubt i have to learn thinks that can’t be done by others like Maths, cryptography and other cool staff. Somehow for me they all sounds really cool. i didn’t went to school after 9th grade. its been 5 years now i’m learning everything by myself.



Through out this learning journey i learned many computer related thinks like different programming languages and different frameworks like react. NextJS etc.



i learned several things that can help me to earn money so that can help business related problems but these skills can’t help me to solve problems for the future. i want to contribute to mankind want to create rockets want to solve problems that world really facing off.

so here’s my new roadmap. obviously i’m not going to collage to learn stuff my life is going to be a proof that we don’t need collage to learn stuff.

currently i’m learning computer programming but soon i will start learning Maths and then starts problem solving no matter if they are programming problem of maths problems i will just solve problems and make my programming & maths skills to the next level.



Thanks Alan.
