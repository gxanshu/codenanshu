## Getting Started

🚀 "Codenanshu" is not only my personal project but also a captivating blog where I eagerly share intriguing facts and knowledge with the world. Through this platform, I strive to offer the key insights I gather on a daily basis. 🌍 This website acts as a treasure trove of knowledge that I'm enthusiastic about sharing—essentially serving as a dynamic note-keeping platform where I pour out my thoughts. 💡

📝 For those who wish to contribute a post, the process is refreshingly simple. There are two methods to craft a post on the site. The first approach involves forking the repository from [this link](https://github.com/gxanshu/codenanshu/fork) and then accessing the 🖋️ [admin CMS](https://codenanshu.in/admin/index.html). From there, you can effortlessly log in using your GitHub account.

📚 Alternatively, you can fork the repository, and in the `src/pages/blog/[post].md` file, unleash your creativity using the captivating Markdown format. Once your post is polished and ready, you can initiate a pull request—an invitation to have your creation reviewed and seamlessly integrated into the platform. 🎉

## Technology I Used 📜:

- [TailwindCSS](https://astro.build/) - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
- [MDXjs](https://astro.build/) - Markdown for the component era.

**I'm going to add more in the future!**
