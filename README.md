## Getting Started

🚀 "Codenanshu" is not only my personal project but also a captivating blog where I eagerly share intriguing facts and knowledge with the world. Through this platform, I strive to offer the key insights I gather on a daily basis. 🌍 This website acts as a treasure trove of knowledge that I'm enthusiastic about sharing—essentially serving as a dynamic note-keeping platform where I pour out my thoughts. 💡

📝 For those who wish to contribute a post, the process is refreshingly simple. There are two methods to craft a post on the site. The first approach involves forking the repository from [this link](https://github.com/gxanshu/codenanshu/fork).

📚 In the `src/pages/blog/[post].md` file, unleash your creativity using the captivating Markdown format. Once your post is polished and ready, you can initiate a pull request—an invitation to have your creation reviewed and seamlessly integrated into the platform. 🎉

## Technology I Used 📜:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Site generator

- [MDXjs](https://astro.build/) - Content management
- [Partytown](https://astro.build/) - Reduce third-party scripts
