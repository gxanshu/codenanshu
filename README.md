## Getting Started

codenanshu is like my personal project as well as a blog to share some fact and knowladge with the world. here i provide the key things that i learn in the daily bases. this website is all about the knowladge that i want to share or a notes keeping website with my own thougts.

if want to write a post then its really so easy. there are two ways to write post in the site the first one is really so simple you need to [folk the repo](https://github.com/aianshume/codenanshu/fork) and then open the [admin CMS](https://codenanshu.in/admin/index.html) then simply just login with your github accout.

another way is just to folk the repo write your post in markdown formet inside `src/pages/blog/[post].md` and the post a pull request.
